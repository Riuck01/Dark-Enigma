THIS PROJECT WAS A MESS

A crash on load when the obkect "BP_BlockedLightPuzzle" was on the scene got us a loooot of trouble and we had to update Unreal to 5.1 to get acccess to our project back.

/!\ This means that this is a 5.5.1 project and not a 5.4.4 /!\

If the last commit on main is named something like "Revert until stop crashing" that means the repos were closed before we could push the corrected project, and there likely is a .zip containing it.

The branch BuildIntoRepairedRaycast is the closest attempt so far to the full-game, including the level and up-to-date BPs. If main is still stuck at the revert commits, this is the most up-to-date branch and should be considered most advanced.
